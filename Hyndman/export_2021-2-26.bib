abstract = {{Guidelines recommend initiating anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation, such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high‐risk features on echocardiography. We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0–3 days, 4–14 days, or >14 days), and outcomes were recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days. Among 2,084 patients, 1,289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1\% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the 3 groups (0–3 days: 10.3\%, 64/617; 4–14 days: 9.7\%, 52/535; >14 days: 10.2\%, 14/137; p = 0.933). In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4 and 14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs 0–3 days; odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–4.43), nor did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs >14 days; OR = 0.76, 95\% CI = 0.36–1.62, p = 0.482). In this multicenter real‐world cohort, the recommended (4–14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:807–816}},

abstract = {{Background and Purpose: In patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation, treatment with low molecular weight heparin increases early hemorrhagic risk without reducing early recurrence, and there is limited data comparing warfarin to direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy. We aim to compare the effects of the treatments above on the risk of 90-day recurrent ischemic events and delayed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: We included consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation from the IAC (Initiation of Anticoagulation after Cardioembolic) stroke study pooling data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We compared recurrent ischemic events and delayed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between each of the following groups in separate Cox-regression analyses: (1) DOAC versus warfarin and (2) bridging with heparin/low molecular weight heparin versus no bridging, adjusting for pertinent confounders to test these associations. Results: We identified 1289 patients who met the bridging versus no bridging analysis inclusion criteria and 1251 patients who met the DOAC versus warfarin analysis inclusion criteria. In adjusted Cox-regression models, bridging (versus no bridging) treatment was associated with a high risk of delayed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 2.74 [95\% CI, 1.01–7.42]) but a similar rate of recurrent ischemic events (hazard ratio, 1.23 [95\% CI, 0.63–2.40]). Furthermore, DOAC (versus warfarin) treatment was associated with a lower risk of recurrent ischemic events (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95\% CI, 0.29–0.87]) but not delayed symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (hazard ratio, 0.57 [95\% CI, 0.22–1.48]). Conclusions: Our study suggests that patients with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation would benefit from the initiation of a DOAC without bridging therapy. Due to our study limitations, these findings should be interpreted with caution pending confirmation from large prospective studies.}},

A multicenter retrospective study, which included 10 comprehensive stroke centers, was carried out. Patients with acute ischemic stroke and anterior circulation large vessel occlusions who achieved successful reperfusion via MT were included.

Safety endpoints included symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, mortality, and requirement for hemicraniectomy during admission. A generalized mixed linear model was used to study the association between SBPr and outcomes. A total of 1361 patients were included in the final analysis. SBPr as a continuous variable was inversely associated with poor outcome (OR=0.97; 95\% CI 0.95 to 0.98; p<0.001) but not with the safety outcomes. Subanalysis based on reperfusion status showed that SBPr was associated with lower odds of poor outcome only in patients with complete reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI 3)) but not in patients with incomplete reperfusion (mTICI 2b). When SBPr was divided into categories (<1\%, 1\%–10\%, 11\%–20\%, >20\%), the rate of poor outcome was highest in the first group. SBPr in the first 24 hours after successful reperfusion was inversely associated with poor outcome. No association between SBPr and safety outcome was found.}},

The Initiation of Anticoagulation after Cardioembolic stroke study is a multicentre retrospective study across that pooled data from consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke in the setting of AF from stroke registries across eight comprehensive stroke centres in the USA. The coprimary outcomes were recurrent ischaemic event (stroke/TIA/systemic arterial embolism) and delayed symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (d-sICH) within 90 days.

In Cox regression models, factors associated with a trend for recurrent ischaemic events were prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) (HR 1.42, 95\% CI 0.96 to 2.10) and ipsilateral arterial stenosis with 50\%–99\% narrowing (HR 1.54, 95\% CI 0.98 to 2.43).

We aim to determine factors associated with therapeutic or supratherapeutic anticoagulation status at the time of ischemic stroke in patients with AF. Methods The Initiation of Anticoagulation after Cardioembolic stroke (IAC) study is a multicenter study pooling data from stroke registries of eight comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. Consecutive patients hospitalized with acute ischemic stroke in the setting of AF were included in the IAC cohort. For this study, we only included patients who reported taking warfarin at the time of the ischemic stroke. Patients not on anticoagulation and patients who reported use of a direct oral anticoagulant were excluded. Analyses were stratified based on therapeutic (INR ≥2) versus subtherapeutic (INR <2) anticoagulation status. We used binary logistic regression models to determine factors independently associated with anticoagulation status after adjustment for pertinent confounders. In particular, we sought to determine whether atherosclerosis with 50\% or more luminal narrowing in an artery supplying the infarct (a marker for a competing atherosclerotic mechanism) and small stroke size (≤ 10 mL; implying a competing small vessel disease mechanism) related to anticoagulant status. Results Of the 2084 patients enrolled in the IAC study, 382 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 77.4 ± 10.9 years and 52.4\% (200/382) were women. A total of 222 (58.1\%) subjects presented with subtherapeutic INR. In adjusted models, small stroke size (OR 1.74 95\% CI 1.10–2.76, p = 0.019) and atherosclerosis with 50\% or more narrowing in an artery supplying the infarct (OR 1.96 95\% CI 1.06–3.63, p = 0.031) were independently associated with INR ≥2 at the time of their index stroke. Conclusion Small stroke size (≤ 10 ml) and ipsilateral atherosclerosis with 50\% or more narrowing may indicate a competing stroke mechanism.

Both procedural and clinical predictors of outcome in posterior circulation patients have not been evaluated in large cohort studies. OBJECTIVE To investigate technical and clinical predictors of functional independence after posterior circulation MT while comparing different frontline thrombectomy techniques. METHODS In a retrospective multicenter international study of 3045 patients undergoing MT for stroke between 06/2014 and 12/2018, 345 patients had posterior circulation strokes. MT was performed using aspiration, stent retriever, or combined approach. Functional outcomes were assessed using the 90-d modified Rankin score dichotomized into good (0-2) and poor outcomes (3-6). RESULTS We included 2700 patients with anterior circulation and 345 patients with posterior circulation strokes. Posterior patients (age: 60 ± 14, 46\% females) presented with mainly basilar occlusion (80\%) and were treated using contact aspiration or ADAPT (39\%), stent retriever (31\%) or combined approach (19\%). Compared to anterior strokes, posterior strokes had delayed treatment (500 vs 340 min, P < .001), higher national institute of health stroke scale (NIHSS) (17.1 vs 15.7, P < .01) and lower rates of good outcomes (31\% vs 43\%, P < .01). In posterior MT, diabetes (OR = 0.28, 95\%CI: 0.12-0.65), admission NIHSS (OR = 0.9, 95\%CI: 0.86-0.94), and use of stent retriever (OR = 0.26, 95\%CI: 0.11-0.62) or combined approach (OR = 0.35, 95\%CI: 0.12-1.01) vs ADAPT were associated with lower odds of good outcome. Stent retriever use was associated with lower odds of good outcomes compared to ADAPT even when including patients with only basilar occlusion or with successful recanalization only. CONCLUSION Despite similar safety profiles, use of ADAPT is associated with higher rates of functional independence after posterior circulation thrombectomy compared to stent retriever or combined approach in large “real-world” retrospective study.}},

Electrodiagnostic studies guide operative planning but the implications for clinical outcomes is not well defined. This case study delineates how clinical examination and electrodiagnostics can define the varying patterns of neuronal injury to guide timing and strategy for optimal outcomes in nerve transfers. We discuss a 20-year-old man with a C6–7 spinal cord injury (SCI). We illustrate how history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic studies predicted patterns of upper and lower motor neuron injury, confirmed intraoperatively via direct nerve stimulation. We undertook brachialis nerve transfer to the median fascicles supplying flexor digitorum superficialis and anterior interosseous nerve (to restore digit flexion), and supinator nerve transfer to posterior interosseous nerve (to restore digit extension). Preoperative electrodiagnostics of the right upper extremity demonstrated a pure upper motor neuron injury to median innervated muscles, and mixed upper and lower motor neuron injury to radial innervated muscles. These findings were confirmed via intraoperative direct neuromuscular stimulation. The preoperative studies provided important information regarding the anatomic basis and time sensitivity of the proposed nerve transfers. At 2 years post operatively the reconstructed digit flexion and extension resulted in improved hand function and independence. Upper and lower motor neuron injuries can coexist in individuals with SCI. This example provides proof-of-concept that preoperative electrodiagnostic studies predict LMN injury, and surgery can achieve positive outcomes if completed soon after SCI.}},

Methods- This was a multicenter study from 10 comprehensive stroke centers. To ensure homogeneity of the studied cohort, we included only patients with anterior circulation who achieved successful recanalization at the end of procedure. Clinical outcomes included 90-day modified Rankin Scale, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), mortality, and hemicraniectomy. Results- A total of 1245 patients were included in the study. Mean age was 69±14 years, and 51\% of patients were female. Forty-nine percent of patients had good functional outcome at 90-days, and 4.7\% suffered sICH. Admission systolic BP (SBP), mean SBP, maximum SBP, SBP SD, and SBP range were associated with higher risk of sICH. In addition, patients in the higher mean SBP groups had higher rates of sICH. Similar results were found for hemicraniectomy. With respect to functional outcome, mean SBP, maximum SBP, and SBP range were inversely associated with the good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2). However, the difference in SBP parameters between the poor and good outcome groups was modest. Conclusions- Higher BP within the first 24 hours after successful mechanical thrombectomy was associated with a higher likelihood of sICH, mortality, and requiring hemicraniectomy.}},

Platelets act as a trigger for neutrophil extravasation to inflammatory sites but mechanisms and tissue-specific aspects of these interactions are currently unclear. Here, we use bacterial endotoxin in mice to trigger an innate inflammatory response in different tissues and measure neutrophil invasion with or without platelet reduction. We show that platelets are essential for neutrophil infiltration to the brain, peritoneum and skin. Neutrophil numbers do not rise above basal levels in the peritoneum and skin and are decreased (\textbackslashtextasciitilde60\%) in the brain when platelet numbers are reduced. In contrast neutrophil infiltration in the lung is unaffected by platelet reduction, up-regulation of CXCL-1 (2·4-fold) and CCL5 (1·4-fold) acting as a compensatory mechanism in platelet-reduced mice during lung inflammation. In brain inflammation targeting platelet receptor GPIbα results in a significant decrease (44\%) in platelet-mediated neutrophil invasion, while maintaining platelet numbers in the circulation. These results suggest that therapeutic blockade of platelet GPIbα could limit the harmful effects of excessive inflammation while minimizing haemorrhagic complications of platelet reduction in the brain. The data also demonstrate the ability to target damaging brain inflammation in stroke and related disorders without compromising lung immunity and hence risk of pneumonia, a major complication post stroke. In summary, our data reveal an important role for platelets in neutrophil infiltration to various tissues, including the brain, and so implicate platelets as a key, targetable component of cerebrovascular inflammatory disease or injury.}},

We subsequently synthesised an account of the study participants’ lived experiences of PAL sessions from individual personal accounts to explore how medical students experience peer-assisted learning. This analysis was then used to complement and critique a priori educational theory regarding the mechanisms underlying PAL. Students experienced PAL sessions as a safe and egalitarian environment, which shaped the type and style of learning that took place. This was facilitated by close relationships with peer-tutors, with whom they shared a strong sense of camaraderie and shared purpose. Peer-tutors felt able to understand their students’ wider sociocultural context, which was the most important factor underpinning both the PAL environment and tutor-student relationship. Participants contrasted this relative safety, camaraderie and shared purpose of PAL with teaching led by more senior tutors in clinical settings. This study provides a rich description of the important factors that characterise medical students’ experiences of PAL sessions. Participants felt a strong sense of support in PAL sessions that took into account their wider sociocultural context. Multiple factors interplayed to create a learning environment and tutor-student relationship that existed in contrast to teaching led by more senior, clinical tutors. The insight generated via IPA complemented existing theory and raised new lines of enquiry to better understand how the peer relationship fosters learning in PAL at medical school. We make recommendations to use insights from PAL for faculty and curriculum development.}},

abstract = {{The immune system is implicated in a wide range of disorders affecting the brain and is, therefore, an attractive target for therapy. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent regulator of the innate immune system important for host defense but is also associated with injury and disease in the brain. Here, we show that IL-1 is a key mediator driving an innate immune response to inflammatory challenge in the mouse brain but is dispensable in extracerebral tissues including the lung and peritoneum. We also demonstrate that IL-1α is an important ligand contributing to the CNS dependence on IL-1 and that IL-1 derived from the CNS compartment (most likely microglia) is the major source driving this effect. These data reveal previously unknown tissue-specific requirements for IL-1 in driving innate immunity and suggest that IL-1-mediated inflammation in the brain could be selectively targeted without compromising systemic innate immune responses that are important for resistance to infection. This property could be exploited to mitigate injury- and disease-associated inflammation in the brain without increasing susceptibility to systemic infection, an important complication in several neurological disorders.}},

It is not known if microglia, a resident brain macrophage population, polarizes in a similar way, and whether specific microglial phenotypes modulate cell death in response to brain injury. In this study, we show that both BV2-microglia and mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were able to adopt different phenotypes after LPS (M1) or IL-4 (M2) treatment in vitro, but regulated cell death differently when added to mouse organotypic hippocampal brain slices. BMDMs induced cell death when added to control slices and exacerbated damage when combined with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), independently of their phenotype. In contrast, vehicle- and M2-BV2-microglia were protective against OGD-induced death. Direct treatment of brain slices with IL-4 (without cell addition) was protective against OGD and induced an M2 phenotype in the slice. In vivo, intracerebral injection of LPS or IL-4 in mice induced microglial phenotypes similar to the phenotypes observed in brain slices and in cultured cells. After injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, microglial cells did not adopt classical M1/M2 phenotypes, suggesting that another subtype of regulatory phenotype was induced. This study highlights functional differences between macrophages and microglia, in response to brain injury with fundamentally different outcomes, even if both populations were able to adopt M1 or M2 phenotypes. These data suggest that macrophages infiltrating the brain from the periphery after an injury may be cytotoxic, independently of their phenotype, while microglia may be protective.}},

IL-1β secretion requires the protease caspase-1, which is activated following recruitment to inflammasomes. Endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from necrotic cells activate caspase-1 through an NLRP3-inflammasome. Here, we show that the endogenous lipid metabolite sphingosine (Sph) acts as a DAMP by inducing the NLRP3-inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1β from macrophages. This process was dependent upon serine/threonine protein phosphatases since the PP1/PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibited Sph-induced IL-1β release. IL-1β release induced by other well-characterized NLRP3-inflammasome activators, such as ATP and uric acid crystals, in addition to NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasome activators was also blocked by these inhibitors. Thus, we propose Sph as a new DAMP, and that a serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1/PP2A)-dependent signal is central to the endogenous host mechanism through which diverse stimuli regulate inflammasome activation.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:neurophobia has been described as a fear of clinical neuroscience, and is known to affect both medical students and junior doctors alike. There is some evidence that it may affect the practice of GPs, who may not feel confident enough to give advice to neurological patients.

CONTEXT:I am a fourth year undergraduate at The University of Manchester, and have undertaken two four-week placements in neurology at the Greater Manchester Neuroscience Centre in Salford. The first was a student-selected component in movement disorders, and the second was part of the standard undergraduate curriculum at the University.

INNOVATION:in this piece I relate my experience of clinical neuroscience training to the theory surrounding neurophobia. I aim to demonstrate how students and teachers can reduce the effect of the phenomenon through the use of good educational strategies. My experience is divided into individual and group learning opportunities. Five points for teachers of clinical neuroscience are presented as possible ideas to help students venturing into clinical neurology for the first time.

IMPLICATIONS:the experience I had during my eight weeks in neurology suggests that neurophobia can be reduced. It is important that clinical teachers have an awareness of the implications of neurophobia in their students so they can both anticipate and counteract its effects.}},

CONTEXT:PAL Manchester is a peer-assisted learning scheme that has run for over 6 years at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. It is a student-led scheme that teaches clinical skills to medical students in years 3-5 of the Manchester curriculum. The scheme comprises small group sessions of 12 students and two peer tutors.

INNOVATION:Here, we present the experiences of PAL Manchester from three perspectives: student (Francesca Liuzzi), peer tutor (Elspeth Hill) and student co-ordinator (James Giles). These accounts illustrate the roles within PAL Manchester and the personal benefits that may be derived from such a scheme.

IMPLICATIONS:Different roles for medical students can be developed within a PAL scheme, presenting different challenges and benefits to participants.}},
